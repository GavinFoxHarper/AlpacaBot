# LAEF Automated Daily Trading Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the LAEF trading system to run automatically every weekday at 9:30 AM and send you daily reports via email.

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Email Configuration (5 minutes)

```bash
python setup_email_config.py
```

This will help you configure:
- Email server settings (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Your email credentials
- Recipients for daily reports
- Test email functionality

**For Gmail Users:**
- Use an "App Password" instead of your regular password
- Go to: Google Account > Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords

### 2. Automated Scheduling (2 minutes)

**Run as Administrator:**
```bash
setup_task_scheduler.bat
```

This creates a Windows scheduled task that:
- Runs Monday-Friday at 9:25 AM
- Waits for market open at 9:30 AM
- Trades throughout the day
- Sends daily report via email
- Automatically shuts down at market close

## üìä Monitoring & Evolution Tracking

### Live Monitoring Dashboard
```bash
python live_monitoring_dashboard.py
```

Shows real-time:
- Q-Learning evolution (epsilon decay, model updates)
- Prediction accuracy and confidence trends  
- Strategy performance evolution
- Portfolio changes and learning progress
- ML model file modifications

### Key Evolution Variables Tracked:

**Q-Learning System:**
- Epsilon (exploration vs exploitation): Starts at 1.0, decays to 0.1 over 100 hours
- Learning rate: Adaptive based on performance
- Model weights: Updated after each prediction outcome
- Reward accumulation: Tracks long-term learning progress

**Prediction Engine:**
- Accuracy rate: Percentage of correct predictions
- Confidence evolution: How certain the bot becomes
- Pattern recognition: New patterns learned daily
- Market regime detection: Adapts to market conditions

**Strategy Evolution:**
- Performance weighting: Better strategies get more allocation
- Parameter optimization: Continuous hyperparameter tuning
- Risk adjustment: Dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels
- Correlation analysis: Identifies redundant strategies

3. **Market Open**: Begins making predictions and trades
4. **Throughout Day**: 
   - Tracks prediction outcomes
   - Updates Q-learning model
   - Adjusts strategy weights
   - Learns new patterns
5. **Market Close**: Generates learning summary
6. **After Hours**: Sends detailed report via email

### Evolution Indicators
- **Epsilon Decay**: Shows learning progress (1.0 ‚Üí 0.1)
- **Accuracy Improvement**: Prediction accuracy over time
- **Strategy Adaptation**: Performance-based weight adjustments
- **Pattern Discovery**: New market patterns learned
- **Risk Evolution**: Dynamic risk management improvements

## üéØ Expected Evolution Timeline

### Week 1: Learning Phase
- High epsilon (exploration)
- Lower accuracy (~40-60%)
- Strategy weight balancing
- Pattern discovery

### Week 2-4: Adaptation Phase
- Decreasing epsilon
- Improving accuracy (~60-75%)
- Strategy specialization
- Risk parameter optimization

### Month 2+: Evolution Phase
- Low epsilon (exploitation)
- High accuracy (~75%+)
- Automated strategy selection
- Advanced pattern recognition

The bot is designed to continuously evolve and improve its performance over time through reinforcement learning and pattern recognition. Daily reports will show this evolution in real-time.

**Remember: Start with paper trading to verify everything works before considering live trading!**
